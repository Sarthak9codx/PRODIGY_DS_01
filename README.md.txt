
PRODIGY_DS_01 — Gender and Age Distribution Visualization

This is my first task as part of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.
In this task, I created a small dataset representing a population of 25 people, including their Age and Gender.
I used Pandas to manage the data and Matplotlib to visualize it.

The visualizations I created are:
 -A Bar Chart showing the Gender Distribution in the population
 -A Histogram showing the Age Distribution in the population


Technologies Used
-Python
-Pandas
-Matplotlib

 What I Learned
Through this task, I gained hands-on experience and practical skills in:
-Creating and manipulating DataFrames with Pandas
-Plotting categorical data using Bar Charts
-Plotting continuous data using Histograms
Adding labels, colors, and titles to visualizations for better readability
Understanding how simple data visualizations can provide insights from raw data



 Personal Reflection
This is also my first internship and my first task in Data Science.
Through this task, I also learned:
-How to use GitHub
-How to post and share work on LinkedIn
-Why we use platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn in a professional setting

#Although I had some basic knowledge about these tools before, this internship helped me gain a much clearer understanding of their importance and practical use.

 #Thank You
I would like to sincerely thank Prodigy Infotech for giving me this wonderful opportunity to learn and grow.
I’m looking forward to completing more tasks and improving my skills!
