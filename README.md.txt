                 Visual Analysis of Gender and Age Data

This project focuses on using Python tools to explore and represent basic demographic information—specifically age and gender—through visualizations.
 Overview of the Dataset:
The dataset includes details about 30 individuals. For each individual, the following data points are included:
 -An ID number (from 1 to 30)
 -Their age
 -Their gender (Male or Female)

What This Project Does:
Dataset Preparation:
  A small sample dataset is manually created using Python’s dictionary and DataFrame functions. It contains both numeric and categorical values.
 Gender-Based Visualization:
  A bar graph is created to illustrate how many individuals identify as male or female. Each gender is shown using a different color, making it easy to compare the two.
 Age-Based Visualization:
  A histogram is plotted to examine how the ages of the 30 individuals are distributed. The age values are grouped into different ranges (bins), allowing us to see which age groups are more common in the sample.

Tools & Libraries Used:
  Pandas is used for organizing the dataset in a tabular format.
Matplotlib is used to create the bar chart and histogram.

Goal of the Project:
  The main aim is to practice data visualization techniques on a small dataset. This includes:
  Understanding how to represent categorical and numerical data graphically.
  Getting insights into population characteristics using simple plots.
